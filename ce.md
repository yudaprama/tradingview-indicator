This is a TradingView Pine Script for the Chandelier Exit indicator. The Chandelier Exit is a technical analysis indicator used to identify potential stop-loss points for a long or short trade. The script calculates the stop-loss levels based on the average true range (ATR) of the security being analyzed and then plots the levels on the chart.

The script accepts three inputs:

- ATR Period: the length of the ATR calculation
- ATR Multiplier: the multiplier applied to the ATR value to determine the stop-loss levels
- Show Buy/Sell Labels: a Boolean value that controls whether the buy/sell labels are displayed on the chart
- The script also includes an option to highlight the current long or short state with color, and it can generate alerts for changes in direction, buy signals, and sell signals.
